# Bank-Loan-Project
In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. Report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and changes. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.
